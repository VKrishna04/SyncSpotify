# SyncSpotify Prime

main.py: This file can contain the main logic of your application, including the UI components and the synchronization process.

spotify_auth.py: This file/module can contain the code related to Spotify authentication.

sync_app.py: This file/module can contain the SyncSpotify_Prime class and any logic related to playlist synchronization.

Here's a brief overview of the files:

1. **main.py**: The main Python script that starts the Flask web application. It handles routes, authentication callbacks, and launches the main logic for syncing playlists.

2. **SpotifyAuthApp.py**: An additional script for handling Spotify authentication using a PyQt5 web view.

3. **spotify_auth.py**: A module for handling Spotify authentication using the spotipy library.

4. **SyncSpotify_Prime.py**: A PyQt5-based GUI application for syncing Spotify playlists to Prime Music playlists.

5. **sync_logic.py**: Placeholder for syncing logic. This is where you would eventually implement the logic for syncing playlists between different services.

6. **framer1.html**: HTML file for a landing page, including buttons for logging in with different music services.

7. **index.html**: The main HTML file for the application, providing an overview and buttons to initiate authentication.

8. **profiles.html**: An HTML file displaying user profile information and a logout button.

can i run flask on the main thread again and shift QApplication to side thread after making all of the selections such as transfer from this account to this account and so on and then it QApplication will send instructions to flask to make api calls and other things to make those changes  and responces are sent back to QApplication  or should we just completly do everything in flask itself instead of changing back and forth between flask and QApplication 

Your idea of separating concerns between Flask and QApplication and shifting the heavy lifting to Flask is a good approach. Here's a suggested workflow:

1. **User Interaction with QApplication:**
   - Use `QApplication` for user interactions, account selections, and other UI-related tasks.

2. **Collect User Input:**
   - After the user has made all selections and you have the necessary information, prepare a request (payload) that you want to send to the Flask backend.

3. **Send Request to Flask Backend:**
   - Make an HTTP request from your QApplication to a specific endpoint in your Flask backend, sending the payload as part of the request.

4. **Flask Backend Processes the Request:**
   - In your Flask backend, define an endpoint to handle this specific request. Extract the payload, perform the necessary logic (like making API calls), and prepare a response.

5. **Flask Sends Response to QApplication:**
   - Send the response back to the QApplication, possibly in a JSON format.

6. **QApplication Processes the Response:**
   - In your QApplication, handle the response from Flask. Update the UI, display relevant information to the user, or take further actions based on the response.

This approach keeps the UI responsive and delegates the backend processing to Flask. It's a common practice to separate the frontend (UI) and backend (business logic) components, especially in web applications.

In your case, you can use the `QApplication` for user interactions and account selections. Once the user has made all selections, you can send a request to your Flask backend, which can then handle the heavy lifting of making API calls and other tasks. The Flask backend can then send a response back to the QApplication, which can then update the UI or take further actions based on the response.

This way, your Flask backend can handle the heavy lifting, and your QApplication remains responsive to user interactions.
